# Intelligent Credit Risk Assessment System

## Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent credit risk classification system using supervised machine learning and ensemble techniques. The system classifies loan applicants into low, medium, and high risk categories based on historical credit and repayment data.

## Objectives
- Automate credit risk assessment
- Reduce subjectivity in loan approval
- Compare multiple machine learning models
- Improve prediction accuracy using ensemble techniques
- Provide explainable model outputs

## Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Correlation Analysis
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Cross-Validation for model comparison
- Feature importance analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
German Credit Risk Dataset (Kaggle)
